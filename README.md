## Installation
For building application you need [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed. Minor version is v6.

For compile styles from sass you need to install [Compass](http://compass-style.org/install/)

- run `npm install`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8081/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `npm run build-stage` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `npm run build-prod` flag for a production build.
